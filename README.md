# Advent-Of-Code-2022

Want to expand my knowdlege of programming languages so choose to Python as tool for this years Advent Of Code.

# Python Version

v.3.10

# Day 1
As usual day 1 of AoC is not that challenging I first completed the task in go but then decided to rewrite solutions in python and stick with it till the end of AoC. The only problem I encountered was the formatting of code when the variable was not resetting when needed cause he was one place to the right.

# Day 2
Quite easy too but got stuck in the second part while counting points for each round it was not a code problem but my calculations problems.

# Day 3 
Quite easy as well but I'm not liking my solution too many stacked for cycles probably will get back to it later on.
