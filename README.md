# [Advent-Of-Code-2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)

Want to expand my knowdlege of programming languages so choose to use Python as tool for this years Advent Of Code.

All the original solutions of the task will be stored in DayXX/main.py but later if I'm not satisfied with the solution new one will be stored at DayXX/improved.py. This way there will be an easy way to compare both old and new solutions and my improvements in Python

# Python Version

3.10

# [Day 01](https://github.com/MantasSilanskas/Advent-Of-Code-2022/blob/master/Day01/main.py)
As usual day 1 of AoC is not that challenging I first completed the task in go but then decided to rewrite solutions in python and stick with it till the end of AoC. The only problem I encountered was the formatting of code when the variable was not resetting when needed cause he was one place to the right.

# [Day 02](https://github.com/MantasSilanskas/Advent-Of-Code-2022/blob/master/Day02/main.py)
Quite easy too but got stuck in the second part while counting points for each round it was not a code problem but my calculations problems.

# [Day 03](https://github.com/MantasSilanskas/Advent-Of-Code-2022/blob/master/Day03/main.py)
Quite easy as well but I'm not liking my solution too many stacked for cycles.

Finally, it catches up to me. Not stripping input of whitespaces etc. After stripping inputs of the whitespaces program returned the correct answer. The second part was interesting because I learned how to create a set of a given range and how **&** work comparing two sets.

# [Day 05](https://github.com/MantasSilanskas/Advent-Of-Code-2022/blob/master/Day05/main.py)

Didn't know how to read data correctly from the input file so hardcoded box arrangements inside the code. Of course, this decision caused a problem as I wrote them in reverse order. After removing box arrangments from the input it was much easier to read the input and use it.
This day can be rewritten much more efficiently using pop() instead of del() etc.

# [Day 06](https://github.com/MantasSilanskas/Advent-Of-Code-2022/blob/master/Day06/main.py)

Quite easy day using set but interesting task non the less learned more about python sets today!

# [Day 07](https://github.com/MantasSilanskas/Advent-Of-Code-2022/blob/master/Day07/main.py)

Today I learned about Dictionaries in python. The whole task was quite interesting at first input was scary but in the end, it was quite easy to parse it. Made another logic mistake in part 2 when looking for the min() value and declared my answer variable as 0 which was the min() value.

# [Day 08](https://github.com/MantasSilanskas/Advent-Of-Code-2022/blob/master/Day08/main.py)

Interesting task again. Learned about all() today and improved my knowledge of the python list. Would like to research if there is a way to don't use 4 for cycle one for each direction.
