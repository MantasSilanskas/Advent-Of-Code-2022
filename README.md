# [Advent-Of-Code-2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)

Want to expand my knowdlege of programming languages so choose to use Python as tool for this years Advent Of Code.

All the original solutions of the task will be stored in DayXX/main.py but later if I'm not satisfied with the solution new one will be stored at DayXX/improved.py. This way there will be an easy way to compare both old and new solutions and my improvements in Python

# Python Version

3.10

# [Day 1](https://github.com/MantasSilanskas/Advent-Of-Code-2022/blob/master/Day01/main.py)
As usual day 1 of AoC is not that challenging I first completed the task in go but then decided to rewrite solutions in python and stick with it till the end of AoC. The only problem I encountered was the formatting of code when the variable was not resetting when needed cause he was one place to the right.

# [Day 2](https://github.com/MantasSilanskas/Advent-Of-Code-2022/blob/master/Day02/main.py)
Quite easy too but got stuck in the second part while counting points for each round it was not a code problem but my calculations problems.

# [Day 3](https://github.com/MantasSilanskas/Advent-Of-Code-2022/blob/master/Day03/main.py)
Quite easy as well but I'm not liking my solution too many stacked for cycles probably will get back to it later on.
